                    <h2>Distributed File Transfer System</h2>

                    A distributed file transfer system using netty. This project just provides a basic framework and
                    supports scalability up to some extent. This basic setup using asynchronous messages and uses just a
                    single thread for managing queue of incoming messages. This limits the scalability which can be
                    solved by creating multiple threads and distributing the work. This approach would take care of the
                    increased number of messages in the queue during increased load.

                    <h2>Technology and Algorithms</h2>

                    The project uses netty for file transfer, protocol buffer for message format, Raft for distributing
                    the state machine and synchronization among machines in a cluster , and CouchDB and H2 Database
                    Engine for storing data. All the source is in Java, both the client and the server and uses Ant
                    build system.
